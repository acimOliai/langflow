## How to Download GTA Chennai City Game for PC for Free?
 
To download GTA Chennai City game for PC for free, you need to have two things: a copy of GTA San Andreas for PC (either original or pirated), and the GTA Chennai City mod file. You can download the mod file from various websites that host GTA mods (such as gtainside.com or gtagaming.com), or from the official website of the mod (gtachennaicity.com). The mod file is usually in a compressed format (such as .zip or .rar), so you need to extract it using a software like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
 
Once you have downloaded and extracted the mod file (which should contain a folder named "GTA Chennai City"), you need to copy it into the directory where you have installed GTA San Andreas on your PC (usually C:\Program Files\Rockstar Games\GTA San Andreas). You need to overwrite any existing files or folders with the same name. This will replace the original files of GTA San Andreas with those of GTA Chennai City.
 
## How to Install and Play GTA Chennai City Game on PC?
 
After you have copied the mod file into your GTA San Andreas directory, you are ready to install and play GTA Chennai City game on your PC. To do so, you need to follow these steps:

1. Run the file named "gta\_sa.exe" from your GTA San Andreas directory. This will launch the game with the mod applied.
