## What is iMachining and How Does It Work?
 
iMachining is a patented technology that was developed by InventorCAM to revolutionize CNC machining. iMachining uses a unique algorithm that calculates the optimal cutting conditions for each toolpath segment, taking into account the geometry, material, tool, and machine parameters. iMachining then generates a smooth and continuous toolpath that maintains a constant chip thickness and avoids sharp changes in direction. This results in faster and smoother machining, reduced heat and wear on the tool and machine, and improved surface quality and accuracy.

iMachining also provides an automatic toolpath optimization feature that can adjust the cutting parameters on the fly based on the real-time feedback from the machine. This feature can compensate for variations in the material hardness, tool deflection, spindle load, and other factors that can affect the machining performance. iMachining can also detect and avoid potential collisions and gouges between the tool and the part or fixture.
 
## What are the Benefits of InventorCAM 2016 for Autodesk Inventor Users?
