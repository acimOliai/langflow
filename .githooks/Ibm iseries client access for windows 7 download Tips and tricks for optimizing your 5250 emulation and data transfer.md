IBM i Access for Windows is a powerful and versatile tool that allows you to interact with your IBM i system from your Windows desktop. You can use it to run 5250 emulation sessions, transfer data between your PC and IBM i, view and manage printer output, access the IBM i integrated file system, and more.
 
One of the most useful features of IBM i Access for Windows is data transfer. Data transfer lets you exchange data between your PC and IBM i in various formats, such as Excel, CSV, XML, etc. You can also use data transfer to run SQL statements on your IBM i database and retrieve the results. Data transfer can be integrated with Excel and OpenOffice, so you can easily import and export data from your spreadsheets.
 
To use data transfer, you need to have a connection to your IBM i system. You can create and manage connections using the IBM i Access for Windows Properties window. You can also use the Data Transfer From IBM i and Data Transfer To IBM i icons on your desktop or in the Start menu. These icons will launch the data transfer wizard, which will guide you through the steps of selecting a source and a target for your data transfer, choosing the options and settings, and running the transfer.

Another feature of IBM i Access for Windows is printer support. Printer support allows you to view and manage the spool files on your IBM i system, as well as print them to your local or network printers. You can also use printer support to create and edit printer sessions, which are configurations that define how your PC communicates with your IBM i printers.
