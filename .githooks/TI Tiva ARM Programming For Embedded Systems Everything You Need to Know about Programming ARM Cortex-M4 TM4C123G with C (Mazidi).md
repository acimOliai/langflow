This book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate engineering students in Electrical and Computer Engineering departments who want to learn about embedded systems programming with ARM microcontrollers. It can also be used by embedded system programmers who want to migrate from 8- and 16-bit legacy chips such as the 8051, AVR, PIC, and HCS08/12 family of microcontrollers to ARM. Designers of the x86-based systems who want to design ARM-based embedded systems can also benefit from this book.
 
This book is based on the first volume of this series (ARM Assembly Language Programming & Architecture by Mazidi & Naimi), which covers the assembly language programming, instructions, and architecture of the ARM and can be used with any ARM chip, regardless of the chip maker. The authors have extensive experience in teaching and writing books on microcontroller programming and embedded systems. They have also created a website for tutorials and support materials: http://www.MicroDigitalEd.com/ARM/TI\_ARM\_books.htm
 
TI Tiva ARM Programming For Embedded Systems: Programming ARM Cortex-M4 TM4C123G with C (Mazidi) is available on Amazon and other online platforms. It has 302 pages and contains numerous examples, exercises, and projects. It is a must-have book for anyone who wants to learn how to program the TI Tiva C series microcontrollers with C.
