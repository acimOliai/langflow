If you want to revert the changes and enable the transparency and blur effects in your Start Menu background, you can follow the same steps as above, but select **Light** for the default Windows mode, **Dark** for the default app mode, and toggle on the switch for the transparency effects.
 
Alternatively, you can use a third-party tool such as [Classic Color Panel](https://www.wintools.info/index.php/classic-color-panel) or [Start10](https://www.stardock.com/products/start10/) to customize the appearance and behavior of your Start Menu. These tools offer more options and features than the built-in settings, such as changing the color scheme, adding textures and gradients, applying skins and themes, and more. However, they may also require more system resources and compatibility updates.
 
Whether you prefer a transparent and blurred or a solid and clear background for your Start Menu, Windows 10 gives you the flexibility to adjust it according to your preferences and needs. You can also experiment with different combinations of colors and modes to find the best look for your desktop.

Another way to customize your Start Menu background is to use a live wallpaper or a slideshow. A live wallpaper is a dynamic image or video that changes according to the time of day, weather, or other factors. A slideshow is a collection of images that rotate periodically. Both options can add some variety and interest to your desktop.
 
To use a live wallpaper or a slideshow for your Start Menu background, you need to download and install a third-party app such as [Video Wallpaper](https://www.push-entertainment.com/video-wallpaper/) or [Dynamic Theme](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/dynamic-theme/9nblggh1zbkw). These apps allow you to choose from a range of sources and settings for your live wallpaper or slideshow, such as Bing images, Flickr photos, local files, online videos, and more. You can also adjust the speed, quality, and frequency of the changes.
