Digital Logic: Applications and Design is a textbook written by John M. Yarbrough, a professor of electrical engineering at Louisiana Tech University. The book covers the fundamentals of combinational and sequential logic design, as well as the applications of digital logic in various fields such as computer science, electronics, and telecommunications. The book also introduces the concepts of programmable logic devices (PLDs), such as EPROMs, PLAs, and EPLDs, and shows how to design digital circuits using these devices.

The book is divided into 12 chapters, each with a clear introduction, objectives, examples, exercises, and summaries. The chapters are organized as follows:
 
- Chapter 1: Introduction to Digital Logic. This chapter provides an overview of the basic concepts and terminology of digital logic, such as binary numbers, Boolean algebra, logic gates, truth tables, and Karnaugh maps.
- Chapter 2: Combinational Logic Design. This chapter explains how to design and analyze combinational logic circuits using various methods, such as algebraic simplification, tabular minimization, and graphical techniques.
- Chapter 3: Combinational Logic Design with MSI and LSI. This chapter introduces the use of medium-scale integration (MSI) and large-scale integration (LSI) devices, such as multiplexers, decoders, encoders, adders, subtractors, comparators, and parity generators.
- Chapter 4: Sequential Logic Design. This chapter covers the principles and techniques of sequential logic design, such as state diagrams, state tables, flip-flops, registers, counters, and shift registers.
- Chapter 5: Sequential Logic Design with MSI and LSI. This chapter extends the concepts of sequential logic design to MSI and LSI devices, such as synchronous and asynchronous counters, shift registers with parallel load and serial input/output, sequence generators and detectors, and memory devices.
- Chapter 6: Algorithmic State Machines (ASMs). This chapter introduces a graphical method for designing sequential logic circuits based on algorithmic state machines (ASMs), which are composed of state boxes, decision boxes, and conditional output boxes.
- Chapter 7: Standard Sequential Logic Modules. This chapter presents some standard sequential logic modules that are commonly used in digital systems design, such as binary multipliers, dividers, arithmetic logic units (ALUs), code converters, serial adders/subtractors/comparators.
- Chapter 8: Introduction to Programmable Logic Devices (PLDs). This chapter explains the basic concepts and features of programmable logic devices (PLDs), such as EPROMs (erasable programmable read-only memories), PLAs (programmable logic arrays), PALs (programmable array logics), GALs (generic array logics), CPLDs (complex programmable logic devices), and FPGAs (field-programmable gate arrays).
- Chapter 9: PLD Applications in Combinational Logic Design. This chapter shows how to design combinational logic circuits using PLDs, such as EPROMs for implementing arbitrary functions or truth tables, PLAs for implementing sum-of-products or product-of-sums expressions,
- Chapter 10: PLD Applications in Sequential Logic Design. This chapter demonstrates how to design sequential logic circuits using PLDs,
such as EPLDs (erasable programmable logic devices) for implementing state machines or counters.
- Chapter 11: Digital Logic Applications. This chapter explores some of the applications of digital logic in various fields,
such as computer arithmetic, error detection and correction codes,
digital communication systems,
digital signal processing,
and microprocessor systems.
- Chapter 12: VHDL for Digital System Design. This chapter introduces the basics of VHDL (VHSIC hardware description language),
a standard language for describing and simulating digital systems at different levels of abstraction.

The book is well-written and comprehensive, with clear explanations, numerous examples, and challenging exercises. The book also provides appendices on number systems, ASCII codes, IEEE/ANSI standard logic symbols, and answers to selected exercises. The book is suitable for undergraduate students who are taking a first course in digital logic design, as well as for professionals who
