## What is the Mount and Blade Warband Aimbot Beta?
 
The Mount and Blade Warband Aimbot Beta is a hack that modifies the game's code to give you an unfair advantage over other players and NPCs. It was created by a user named kath, who posted it on the unknowncheats.me forum[^2^]. According to kath, the mod features:

- WFAS aimbot: automatically aims at enemies in With Fire & Sword mode
- Napoleonic Wars aimbot: automatically aims at enemies in Napoleonic Wars mode
- PW aimbot: automatically aims at enemies in Persistent World mode
- Wallhack: allows you to see enemies through walls
- ESP: shows information about enemies such as health, distance, name, etc.
- Auto attack: automatically swings your weapon at the nearest enemy
- Perfect auto block: blocks all incoming attacks without fail
- Super zoom hack: allows you to zoom in and out with any weapon
- + more: unspecified additional features

The mod also comes with a video demonstration[^1^] and a setup guide[^2^]. The mod requires a license to use, which can be purchased from lemoncheats.net[^1^]. The mod is compatible with Windows 7 64-bit and Windows 8 64-bit.
