## Step 4: Read some Virtua Cop: Elite Edition reviews
 
If you want to know more about Virtua Cop: Elite Edition, you can read some reviews from various sources online. Here are some excerpts from some of the reviews:
 
- "Virtua Cop: Elite Edition is a great little light gun that you will have no trouble in finishing. The single-player option is a little boring but when you have a group of friends over, it makes a great party game. This game was tested with both the lightgun and DualShock and they both performed exceptionally well."
- "Virtua Cop: Elite Edition comprises both of the original Virtua Cop games in their low-poly, intensely short states. Up the continue count on the option screen and you can actually complete both games in one sitting - in about 90 minutes. [...] However, Sega isn't likely to get a penny from anybody if it continues to peddle this sort of soulless re-release."[^2^]
- "The gameplay is as youâd expect it to be from a rail shooter, you donât control the movement, the only thing the player does is aim and shoot. Simple yet effective gameplay. [...] Despite the graphics being dated even by PS2 standards, thereâs something wonderfully charming about them."[^3^]

As you can see, the reviews are mixed, but most of them agree that Virtua Cop: Elite Edition is fun to play with a light gun and a friend. If you are looking for a nostalgic arcade shooter that doesn't take itself too seriously, you might enjoy Virtua Cop: Elite Edition.
