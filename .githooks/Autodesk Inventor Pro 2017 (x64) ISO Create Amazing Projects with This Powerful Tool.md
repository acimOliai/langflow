## What are the features and benefits of Autodesk Inventor Pro 2017 (x64) ISO~?
 
Autodesk Inventor Pro 2017 (x64) ISO~ has many features and benefits that make it a powerful and versatile software for 3D mechanical design and engineering. Here are some of them:
 
- **Parametric modeling:** You can create parametric models that are driven by dimensions, constraints, features, and equations. You can also edit your models by changing the parameters or features without losing the design intent.
- **Direct modeling:** You can create direct models that are driven by geometry rather than parameters. You can also edit your models by pushing and pulling faces or edges without affecting the underlying topology.
- **Freeform modeling:** You can create freeform models that are driven by sculpting tools rather than geometry. You can also edit your models by adding or removing control points or curves without affecting the underlying surface.
- **Sheet metal modeling:** You can create sheet metal models that are driven by rules and parameters. You can also edit your models by adding or removing flanges, bends, cuts, holes, or patterns without affecting the flat pattern.
- **Assembly modeling:** You can create assembly models that are driven by constraints and joints. You can also edit your models by adding or removing components or subassemblies without affecting the assembly structure.
- **Drawing creation:** You can create drawing views of your models that are driven by standards and annotations. You can also edit your drawings by adding or removing dimensions, symbols, notes, tables, or balloons without affecting the model data.
- **Simulation and analysis:** You can perform various types of simulation and analysis on your models such as stress analysis, motion analysis, thermal analysis, fluid dynamics analysis,
and more. You can also optimize your designs by applying loads,
constraints,
materials,
and factors of safety.
- **Rendering and animation:** You can create photorealistic renderings
and animations
of your models using
the built-in 8cf37b1e13
